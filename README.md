Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a company that wanted to develop a web based based on a existing game called Draw it or lose it. this is currently on an android platform but they     would like to expand in orther to capture more audience. 
  Some of their requirements include, the ability to have multi player platform with multiple teams, and the use of a storage based system that would store a library of     pictures to render in the game and the Players would have the ability to draw based on this rendering. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  Understanding the Hardware needs for a game like this, and also the evaluiation and recommendation portion of this document. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  it really puts in perspective the process and gives you a more organized way of working rather than just writing code like a madman. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would improve on the Requirements and constraints. there is much more needed and the information is understandable for the course but I think some things, in real        life definitly need an answer, like budget constraints. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  the user is our customer, and We work toward the customer's needs. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Really did some research as well on the internet. the singleton instance was painful but it made sense in the end. 
  definitely analyzing the problem before coding.
